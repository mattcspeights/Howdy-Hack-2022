        I attended my first Hackathon hosted at Texas A&M, where I sought out to create an online voter form.
        This was my first attempt at creating a front-end web application, and even though it wasn't completed or close to being a viable product it was a great experience for myself.

          Over the months in the summer of 2022, I started relearning linear algebra and teaching myself fourier series.
          Out of this personal learning goal came an interest in applying my knowledge to C/C++ libraries created by myself.
