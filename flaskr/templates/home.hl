        I attended my first Hackathon hosted at Texas A&M, where I sought out to create an online voter form.
        This was my first attempt at creating a front-end web application, and even though it wasn't completed or close to being a viable product it was a great experience for myself.

        Over the months in the summer of 2022, I started relearning linear algebra and teaching myself fourier series.
        Out of this personal learning goal came an interest in applying my knowledge to C/C++ libraries created by myself.

        This project grew from a project assigned for my "Foundations of Software Engineering" class and became the perfect foundation to learn front-end development and showcase myself.

        Over the summer of 2021, I had an internship with a startup company called Maxwell IoT Technologies that took a particular interest in Helium. 
        Helium is a that company specializs in LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) routers and attaching a cryptocurrency as a reward to hosting these routers.
        I had the special task of creating some sort of HTML scraper that returned the current price of the HNT token (Helium's cryptocurrency) because because API access to the website had a paywall.
